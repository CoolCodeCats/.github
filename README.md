# Welcome to the CoolCodeCats GitHub organization!

This is a casual place to create your own repository, work on new skills, learn something new, test out new features, or really whatever you want.
There will be others in the group with various skill-sets. That way, we can all help each other out and progress our coding knowledge.
This is a casual stress-free environment, but sometimes it helps having others in a space with you, like a coffee shop, to get work done.

All the repositories will vary in coding language and purpose.

NOTE: Please do NOT put sensitive information in this organizations repositories. It is not guarunteed that it is private. Any IP or trade secrets from a company/org should not be included in here.

That being said, it is a good place to test out new libraries, techniques, math, etc. that may be applicable to your career and work projects, but use a test dataset if anything. 

Anyways, this will change and be formatted more properly as we go forward.
Have fun!
