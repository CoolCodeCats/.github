# Point of Docs Folder

The docs folder should be used in order to save out general instructions that will help EVERY repository.

Regardless of the project being set-up, files in the docs are applicable across many realms, for example;

* Setting up a python environment and managing imports using poetry
* setting up VScode and working with branches in it
* Creating a virtual machine and partitioning your hardware
* etc...
